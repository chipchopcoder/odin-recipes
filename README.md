Reflection

hi guys this is my very first website that i made, i actually uploaded it and shared it to a friend
i will be taking ICT elective this upcoming grade 10 academic year and planning to go STEM for my strand
i will take computer science as well (hopefully) in college at our nation's state uni
this was a fun project to make and i want to extend my most sincere gratitude to the people over at Odin Project for making such a wonderful course to follow
check them out - https://www.theodinproject.com
i've tried learning html b4 at freecodecamp but this course was wayy WAYYY more in-depth and easier to follow, i definitely feel like working at a company when using GIT lol (my first time as well)
so far my coding journey's been excellent and i hope to continue learning even more languages such as CSS, JAVASCRIPT and etc. so that i can program a (better) aralinks lol, my frustration with that website is kind of my motivation 
anyways, a message to my future self "I hope you know that whatever people say on whether the things you dream... never stop fighting. You must keep going, even if you are the only one"   


















-lol that was from a yoru line (valo)
