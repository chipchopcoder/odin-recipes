    <h2>Description</h2>
<div class="content">
    <p>This Baked Salmon With Cream Cheese is a great way to liven up your fish and really pack in the flavour! Adding the dill cream cheese to the top of the salmon keeps it so juicy and adding the wonderful flavours of dill and garlic. What could be better?</p>
    <p>The thing you will love the most about this easy salmon recipe is that you can add whatever you want to the cream cheese. You can add lemon, garlic, dill or any other spice you like. Most of the time you try to add flavour and spices to salmon and they run off, but this makes all the flavour stick to the fish!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp pressed garlic or 1/4 of a clove garlic</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh chopped dill or dried</li>
        <li>2 pcs Salmon 2 pieces about <em>5"x3"</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre heat your oven to <strong>400 degrees F</strong>.</li>
        <li>Prepare your glass baking dish by greasing the bottom. If using a flat baking pan line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Take your cream cheese in a medium bowl and warm it in the microwave just so it is a little bit soft. </li>
        <li>Once the cream cheese is softened,  add the garlic and fresh dill and mix by hand or by mixer, both will work.</li>
        <li>If your salmon has skin on one side, place that side down in the baking dish.</li>
        <li>Spoon the cream cheese  mixture onto the top of the  salmon. You may need to flatten it down with your fingers as it can stick to the spoon.</li>
        <li>Place into the preheated oven uncovered, and bake for about <em>20 - 25 minutes</em> until the cream cheese on top is just staring to turn golden brown. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
